# Roadmap:
  * restore original gameplay ( 1.0 )
    * circle for naub overflow
    * menu
  * alternating game modes

# Known Issues
  * keep on looking for the 3-way-join-bug
  * colorsystem needs rebuilding (glow does not work)
  * naubs kinda jiggle in chromium (due to prerendering)
  * slingshooting naubs out of the field is possible (causes crash)
  * stretching effect causes joins to be 1px all the time in opera

# wishes
  * simplify the drawing chain
  * global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
  * color palettes also handle background and join color
  * more canvas performance optimization posible
