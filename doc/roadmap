# vim:set ft=changelog:
# Roadmap:
  * restore original gameplay ( 1.0 )
    * circle for naub overflow
    * menu
  * alternating game modes

# Known Issues
  * performance: need to look over every single floating point operation
  * usability: play and pause button should have the same color
  * bug: keep on looking for the 3-way-join-bug
  * bug: naubs kinda jiggle in chromium (due to pre rendering)

# wishes
  * improve:   decouple step timer and draw timer
  * improve:   global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
  * improve:   more canvas performance optimization posible
  * improve: replace 1000/n fps calculation with requestAnimationFrame
  * simplify:  the drawing chain
  * beauty:    destruction of cycle should start at focused_naub
  * beauty:    color palettes also handle background and join color (for theming)
