# Roadmap:
  * restore original gameplay ( 1.0 )
    * circle for naub overflow
    * menu
  * alternating game modes

# Known Issues
  * need to look over every single floating point operation
  * play and pause button should have the same color
  * keep on looking for the 3-way-join-bug
  * naubs kinda jiggle in chromium (due to prerendering)
  * remove 1000/n fps calculation 

# wishes
  * simplify the drawing chain
  * destruction of cycle should start at focused_naub
  * global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
  * color palettes also handle background and join color
  * more canvas performance optimization posible
