# Roadmap:
  * restore original gameplay ( 1.0 )
    * naub pair creating timer
    * point counter
      * more rewording system
    * circle for naub overflow
    * menu ( restarting 
  * alternating game modes

# Known Issues
  * simplify the drawing chain
  * global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
  * color palettes also handle background and join color
  * stretching effect causes joins to be 1px all the time in opera
  * naubs kinda jiggle in chromium
  * more canvas performance optimization posible
