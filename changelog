## Imidiate Plans:
# incorporate underscore
# global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
# color palettes also handle background and join color
# modi ( scriptable levels )
# naub animation

	* added: prerendering by default (saves about 15% less cpu)

	* cleanup: split NaubShape into NaubBall -> NaubShape
	* cleanup: cleaned up the code a little... a lot
