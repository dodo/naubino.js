## Imidiate Plans:
# global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
# color palettes also handle background and join color

	* added: js-signals (finally decided upon a an event system)
	* added: generic GameMode listening to all the signals (can be overwriten as needed)
	* littered: signals all over the place
	* added: naubs can now gracefully destroy themselves...
	* added: ... so they will do when a cycle is closed
