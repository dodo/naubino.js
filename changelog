## Roadmap:
# integration of kinetic2d js
# fix "pull naubs out of canvas" crash
# timer clean up
# global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
# color palettes also handle background and join color

	* fixed: destroyed naubs now take over painting their joins for animation
	* added: kinetic2d js (not yet in use)
