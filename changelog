## Imidiate Plans:
# naubino namespace
# global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
# color palettes also handle background and join color
# cycle checking
# modi ( scriptable levels )
# naub animation

the hardest part is done (I hope)

	* added: focused naubs now glow (yes! I procrastinated)
	* added: working cycle test
	* optimized: join_springs now uses each naubs own list of joined naubs
	* changed: index.html canvas size and position
