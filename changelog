## Imidiate Plans:
# naubino namespace
# global object size handling ( keep_distance, spring length and so on)
# color palettes also handle background and join color

	* added: basic settings key value file
	* added: colorschemes from colorlovers.com
	* added: spacebar causes pause
	* added: joining

	* fixed: cleaned up physics a bit
	* fixed: one collision does not need to be handled 8 times ;)
	* fixed: correct drawing of joins
